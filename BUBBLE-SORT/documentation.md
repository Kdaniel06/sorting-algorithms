# Bubble Sort Algorithm 💦
This folder contains the implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm, a simple sorting algorithm based on comparing and swapping adjacent elements.

## Description
Bubble Sort compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.

## Features of This Implementation
* In-Place Sorting: No additional memory is required to sort the elements.
* Comparison-Based: Sorting decisions are made by comparing adjacent elements.

### Bubble Sort Workflow 🚀
1. Compare each pair of adjacent elements in the list.
2. Swap them if they are in the wrong order.
3. Repeat this process for each element until the entire list is sorted.

### Complexity ⏱️
* Time Complexity:
    * Best Case: O(n) (When the list is already sorted)
    * Average Case: O(n²)
    * Worst Case: O(n²)
* Space Complexity: O(1) (No additional memory required).

### Advantages and Disadvantages ⚖️
#### Advantages:
* Simple to implement.
* Requires minimal memory.

#### Disadvantages:
* Inefficient for large datasets.
* Has quadratic time complexity.

## When to Use Bubble Sort? 📌
Bubble Sort is useful for small lists that are already partially sorted or when an extremely simple implementation is required.

## Conclusion 📝
Bubble Sort is an intuitive and easy-to-implement sorting algorithm, but it is highly inefficient for large lists.

# Insertion Sort Algorithm ✒️
This folder contains the implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm, a method based on building a sorted list element by element.

## Description
Insertion Sort works by dividing the list into a sorted part and an unsorted part and inserting each element from the unsorted part into the correct position in the sorted part.

## Features of This Implementation
* In-Place Sorting: Sorts the elements without additional memory.
* Comparison-Based: Inserts elements in the correct position through comparison.

## Insertion Sort Workflow 🚀
1. Start with the first element as the sorted sublist.
2. For each element in the unsorted part, insert it into the correct position in the sorted sublist.

## Complexity ⏱️
* Time Complexity:
    * Best Case: O(n) (When the list is already sorted).
    * Average Case: O(n²).
    * Worst Case: O(n²).
* Space Complexity: O(1).

## Advantages and Disadvantages ⚖️
### Advantages:
* Efficient for small or nearly sorted lists.
* Stable and simple to implement.

### Disadvantages:
* Inefficient for large lists due to its quadratic complexity.

## When to Use Insertion Sort? 📌
Insertion Sort is useful for small lists or when the list is already partially sorted.

## Conclusion 📝
Insertion Sort is a simple and efficient algorithm for small or nearly sorted lists, but it is not suitable for large datasets.

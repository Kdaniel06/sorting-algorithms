# Heapsort Algorithm üìä
This project contains the implementation of the Heapsort algorithm, a comparison-based sorting technique that utilizes a binary heap data structure. This algorithm is known for its efficiency and in-place sorting capabilities, making it suitable for sorting large datasets.

## Description
Heapsort is a popular sorting algorithm with a consistent time complexity of O(n log n) for all cases. It is efficient and performs well for large datasets, and it does not require additional memory for its operations. The implementation presented here follows these two main phases:

1. Build a Max Heap from the input array.
2. Extract the Maximum Element repeatedly to sort the entire array.

### Features of This Implementation
1. In-Place Sorting: Heapsort is performed without using additional space, making the sorting efficient in terms of memory usage.
2. Comparison-Based: The sorting decision is based on comparisons between elements.
3. Binary Heap Utilization: The algorithm uses the properties of a max heap to ensure the largest value is always at the root.

## Heapsort Workflow üöÄ
The algorithm can be summarized in these steps:

1. Build a Max Heap:

    * The initial phase involves building a max heap from the input array. 
    * Starting from the last non-leaf node, heapify the sub-tree rooted at each node to maintain the heap property.

2. Sort the Array:

    * Swap the root (maximum value) with the last element.
    * Reduce the heap size by one and heapify the affected root to restore the heap property.
    * Continue this process until the entire array is sorted.
    
## Complexity ‚è±Ô∏è
* Time Complexity:

    * Best Case: O(n log n)
    * Average Case: O(n log n)
    * Worst Case: O(n log n)

    Heapsort's time complexity remains O(n log n) regardless of the arrangement of input data, which makes it a reliable choice for large-scale sorting.

* Space Complexity: O(1) (Heapsort is an in-place sorting algorithm that requires no additional memory for sorting).

## Advantages and Disadvantages ‚öñÔ∏è
### Advantages:
* Predictable Performance: O(n log n) in all scenarios.
* In-Place Sorting: Heapsort sorts the data without requiring additional storage.

### Disadvantages:
* Not Stable: Heapsort is not a stable sorting algorithm, which means that the relative order of elements with equal keys may not be preserved.
* Cache Inefficiency: Due to the nature of tree traversal, Heapsort may have poorer cache performance compared to algorithms like Quicksort.

## When to Use Heapsort? üìå
Heapsort is ideal for applications where memory usage is constrained and where a reliable O(n log n) time complexity is required. It is suitable for embedded systems and cases where in-place sorting is preferred over stability.

## Conclusion üìù
Heapsort is a powerful and efficient sorting algorithm, particularly useful for its in-place sorting capabilities and consistent time complexity. However, its lack of stability and potentially suboptimal cache performance mean that in some situations, other algorithms like Quicksort or Merge Sort might be more appropriate.

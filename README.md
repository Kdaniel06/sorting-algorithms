# Sorting Algorithms Collection
Welcome to the Sorting Algorithms Collection! This repository contains a collection of sorting algorithms implemented in multiple programming languages. It serves as a resource for learning and understanding different sorting techniques, along with their performance characteristics and use cases.

## üìã Overview
Sorting algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science, used in countless applications for organizing and retrieving data efficiently. In this repository, you‚Äôll find several well-known sorting algorithms, each implemented in different languages to provide a diverse learning experience.

## üöÄ Algorithms Included
* Bubble Sort: A simple but inefficient algorithm, best suited for small datasets or educational purposes.
* Selection Sort: Finds the smallest element repeatedly and places it in order, with O(n¬≤) complexity.
* Insertion Sort: Builds a sorted array one item at a time, suitable for small data or nearly sorted datasets.
* Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm with guaranteed O(n log n) performance.
* Quick Sort: Highly efficient, using partitioning to sort elements with average O(n log n) complexity.
* Heap Sort: Uses a max heap to sort the data, ensuring O(n log n) time complexity.
* Radix Sort: An efficient, non-comparative sorting algorithm for integers or strings with multiple digits or characters.

## üîó Languages Used
The algorithms are implemented in various programming languages, including but not limited to:

* Python
* Java
* C++
* JavaScript

Feel free to browse the code to understand how these algorithms look in each language, and to compare the efficiency and differences in implementation.

## üß† Key Concepts Explained
For each sorting algorithm, we provide:

* Algorithm Explanation: Detailed description of how the algorithm works.
* Time Complexity: Best, average, and worst-case time complexities.
* Space Complexity: How much extra space each algorithm requires.
* When to use: Best suited scenarios for each algorithm.
* Advantages and disadvantages: Pros and cons for each algorithm.
